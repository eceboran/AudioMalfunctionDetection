1 : The pump, fan and slide rail sounds are all continouous sounds. The Valve sounds however are not so, and each sound file contains several of open and close movements at different times. Is it reasonable to assume that it is more accurate to listen to each open / close movement individually?
2 : Each machine type is plit up into different models. How similar are the models? Is it reasonable to assume that the sounds of an normal vs abnormal functionaing are similar enough to be treated as one or are the so different that we will have to split the functioning?
3 : For each machine type there are different types of abnormalities. Are these categorized anywhere?
4 : Percentage of abnormal samples are representative for the actual ratio of malfunctions?

Answers & insights from the client: 

1 : The largest sample of sounds is better.
2 : Pumps catagorizes by power, heavy power and lower power consumption.
3 : Spectrum of failure, there is no particular use in splitting them up.
4 : Percentage of abnormal samples are not representative for the actual ratio of malfunctions. In essence the goal is to bring the ratio to as slow as possible.

- Technical staff with knowledge of the machines themselves will be using the dashboard. 
- If certainty is high enough there is a possibility that the machines will stop automatically based on our predictions.
- It would be optimal to listen to all the models together, just one mic would be perfect for all the models.
- Preferably detections should function in real-time.
